It does not have many features right now . But these are the basic ones  it does have :

- Ability to Follow another User

## To-Do
These are the features I have been trying to (or planning to ) add in the future :

- Feed for a User which will consist of only the posts made by the Users whom they follow
- Ability to set a Profile picture for a User
- Ability to chat with a User

## What am I Using? 

- `Flask` with `Python` for the back-end server
- `MongoDb` as the Databse 
- Plain `html`/`css`/`javascript` for the front end
- `Ajax` for communicating with the sever
